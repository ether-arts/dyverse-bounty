# The Dyverse Bounty Hunt is soon LIVE!

:boom: **Check out our Kickstarter campaign [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vrexlab/kydys-in-the-dyverse-unique-diy-toys-you-can-own-f)!**

### About Dyverse

- The Dyverse is a decentralized universe of Kydys - curious, traveling creatures whose identity are stored as non-fungible tokens, based on the ERC-721 standard.
- The Dyverse strives to allow its users a complete ownership of unique 3D characters: a Kydy can be used as your own YouTube creator persona, a playable character in games and also a 3D-printed DIY toy you collect. Kydys are meant to be extended beyond the Dyverse with provable ownership record on the Ethereum network. 
- Inspired by the pioneering kitties at the Cryptokitties, Kydys too can be easily bought, sold, transferred and bred over the Ethereum network. 
- We will be actively creating and supporting additional games and DApps on the Dyverse, and we hope that you could be one of the creators too!
- We are currently on the Rinkeby test network, so this bountry hunt will take place within the Rinkeby network.
